        We recruit researcher and students with interests in areas including modelling
        and simulation, numerical methods, numerical methods, mathematical software,
        and high-performance and parallel computing. If you are interested please send
        your CV to Hilde Hambro (<a href="mailto:hh463@cam.ac.uk">hh463\@cam.ac.uk</a>).


        #### Post-docs/research associates

        Support for post-doctoral scholars and research associates is available
        through a variety of fellowship schemes.

        A number of post-doctoral research associate posts on simulation high-performance
        computing will be opening soon.


        #### PhD positions

        A range of scholarships/studentships are available for other PhD projects.

        Two funded PhD studentships, starting in October 2025,
        are available on modelling, simulation and high-performance computing
        with application to hydrogen-powered aero-engines. The projects are *EPSRC
        Industrial Doctoral Landscape Awards* awards
        in collaboration with
        <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/">Rolls-Royce</a>. The topics of the studentships
        are:
        1.  High-performance, scalable parallel solvers for contact problems.

            Design, analysis and application of robust, parallel numerical solvers for
            modelling contact under mechanical and thermal loadings. This will include
            creating methods that are suited for GPUs and which will run on the world's
            largest supercomputers.

        2.  Fast computational techniques for simulating and optimising single crystal
            casting.

            Creation of new numerical techniques for fast, high-fidelity computer modelling
            of casting of single crystal components. The highly accurate models will include thermal,
            mechanical and fluid processes. The new computer models will be used to optimise
            casting processes, leading to new and improved casting for aerospace applications.

        Funding is for four years, and includes opportunities to spend time on site
        at Rolls-Royce in the Future Technologies team.


        The studentships are restricted to UK residents.
        Please send expressions of interest, including your CV, to
        Hilde Hambro (<a href="mailto:hh463@cam.ac.uk">hh463\@cam.ac.uk</a>).
